# steamWebApp-TDK

### Overview
This was the final project for my Web Programming Course. I am using this as a space for working with web applications and JavaScript in my freetime so that I can hone my skills a bit more with a working application.

### Host locally

Clone the repo, start up a virtual environment, and install the requirements.

```
python3 -m .venv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the games_app.py file.

`python3 games_app.py`

Open a browser and connect to the server using the home IP address and port 8000.

`127.0.0.1:8000`
